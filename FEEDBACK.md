Front End: Multi-Step Wizard

## Overall Thoughts
This proved to be a challenge, but I enjoyed it. I had to brush up on some CSS skills, but I believe my end product is a good minimum viable product.

## Future Development
While working on this challenge, I came across a few features that I decided were best for future development:
- Using modals instead of alerts
- The password isn't the most secure, and I thought about using bcrypt, but for the sake of time I did not. This could easily be solved with the creation of the database (whether sql or nosql), and encrypting the password through the models
- The app image in the side bar isn't responsive as the window gets smaller/larger
