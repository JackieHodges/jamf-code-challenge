Front End: Multi-Step Wizard

Given the the mockups in the `_mockups` folder, I created a multi-step wizard using React from scratch. 

The NavBar and SideBar are examples of possible component re-use. This would allow for expansion to other pages while maintaining a cohesive theme.

By implementing BootStrap, I was able to create a responsive design and have a quick solution for things such as buttons, forms, etc.

## Requirements
In this project, I was able to accomplish the following requirements:

 - Form inputs match what are given in the mockups
 - The user cannot proceed to the next step until they have completed all fields
 - The `_data/mock.json` is dynamically loaded as the dropdown options in step 2
 - The final step allows the user to verify the entered data through a read-only mode
